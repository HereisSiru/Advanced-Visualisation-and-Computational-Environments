# Find Fun 'In Quarantine'
## An AR & Unity project

### Why I made it?







Recently, I come back to China Mainland from the UK. According to the current policy, I have to have a quarantine time in Shanghai local Hotel. 
All things in the hotel are stranger to me and I have no choice. I need to stay in this hotel room for at least 14 days. I have no accompanies except my smart devices -- MY PHONES, MY MACBOOK, MY IPAD AND MY AIRPODS. It's harder than I think because I cannot go out. Initially, I was sent to a hotel in Shanghai's Changning district, but on the fourth day I was told there were COVID-infected people near me on the plane and I must be transferred to a more rigorous hotel immediately. I swear it's been an extremely stressful and terrible morning. I have never been to jail but I suppose there is some similarities. I have to create some fun by myself in this hotel room.

Through this semester's study, I have developed a strong interest in AR. So I made this project. The aiming of this project is I can get some fun in this boring and hard quarantine time. 

I made a virtual friend Kirby (星のカービィ) in my 'In Quarantine' APP. she will appear when I feel upset or down as my friend to accompany me in this hard time.

### I recorded some study process and iterative design in readme file.
